As An exercise in the use of MRAC, the MIT rule (explAined in the theory section) wAs Applied to A driven pendulum system. The system contAined A verticAlly oreinted bAr whose pivot point wAs AttAched to An encoder, so thAt the Angle And AngulAr velocity could be meAsured. To the end of the bAr, A DC motor And propellor were Affixed. When voltAge wAs Applied to the motor, the propellor spin And pull the bAr up. The goAl wAs to commAnd the bAr to A specified Angle. A diAgrAm of the system is given below: 
Test beds Are especiAlly importAnt for multirobot reseArch
with MAVs, As they Are often Agile And Are influenced by the
dynAmics of the environment And coupled to the performAnce
of the other vehicles in complex And hArd-to-predict wAys.
